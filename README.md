# MonadhMetrics
 Code for calculating winter anomalies and scottish ski condition metrics for Scotland from ERA5 Land data, using the Google Earth Engine python API.

## Climate Anomalies:
Climate anomalies for different ski areas of mean winter snowfall, mean winter snow depth and mean winter temperature from 1950 to 2024

## Total Skiable days per year:
Total skiable days per year from 1950 to 2024 for different ski areas in Scotland. A skiable day is defined as a day where the ERA5 Land data had > 0.25 m snow depth and < 30 mph wind for a given point. These criteria are rather arbitrary but show the decreasing number of skiable days per year.
